# Pylang generator
The purpose of this generator is to generate (hopefully) coherent-sounding conlangs used in fantasy settings.

# How it (should) work
## Vowel and Consonant Generation
Both `generate_vowel_inventory` and `generate_consonant_inventory` take in `n` arguments and generate a list of consonants and vowels.


# Next Steps
- Add language families for the vowels and consonants to add to the `generate_*_inventory` functions to tailor the generators towards a certain 'feel'
- Implement the `duplicate: bool` logic for `generate_syllable_from_pattern` function
